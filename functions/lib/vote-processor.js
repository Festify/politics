     * Order calculation is based on a formula, so we don't have to keep an
     * index for ordering tracks.
     *
     * Because a Firebase Query is always sorted in ascending order,
     * the first track should have the lowest value. The value of the
     * other tracks should therefore ascend after that, sorted by vote count,
     * then by the time of insertion.
     *
     * DISCLAIMER: The following is not mathematically proven, but we think
     * it should work.
     *
     * The currently playing track should always be the first track in the list,
     * which is why we assign it the lowest safe integer value possible.
     * The first part of the formula ensures sorting by time of insertion,
     * and because we want the vote count to always outweigh the time delta,
     * we multiply it by a very large factor (10^12 in this case) and subtract it.
